## Implementation_of_Integer_division_algorithm
1. Write a program that implements an adder/subtractor function for two n-bit binary integers A and B represented in 2s complement format.  Name this function AddSub.
2.  Then write a program that faithfully implements the flowchart in the 1st attachment. For implementation of +/- operations of the  flowchart, call the AddSub function as designed in point  1. Your program should ideally use only those variables that are mentioned in the attached flowchart, namely, n, A, M, Q, Q_0, and Count. However, if your program uses more variables than them, identify them in the code using commented lines.
